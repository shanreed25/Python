# Turtle Module
- provides a "turtle" object that acts as a drawing pen, moving and drawing on a canvas to create graphics
- `turtle.Turtle()` is used to create a new "turtle" object
  - invokes the constructor of the Turtle class, creating a new instance of a Turtle object
    - allowing you to create multiple independent turtle objects
  - comes with a set of methods that allow you to manipulate its position, orientation, appearance, and drawing behavior

- [Turtle Object]() 
- [Screen Object]()

# Colors
- the turtle module likes to work with color [tuples]()





While hideturtle() makes the turtle icon disappear, it does not remove the drawings made by that turtle. You would still need clear() to remove the drawn shapes.
