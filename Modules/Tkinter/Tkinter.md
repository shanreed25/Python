# Importing Tkinter
- all components come from the `tkinter` class
- `import tkinter`
    - when importing like this we have to use `tkinter.Tk()` for every component/widget
    - use if you are going to just use a few components 
- `from tkinter import *`
    - when importing liked this using *(all) will import all components then we can use components like this `TK()`
    - use if you are going to use alot of the components , this will help cut down on typing
