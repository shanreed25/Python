# Root Window
- the root window is the main window of a Tkinter application, typically created using `Tk()`
    - `root = tkinter.Tk()`
- the window is going to scale to include all components that you put inside
- `root.minsize(width=500, height=300)`
    - specifies a minimum size, so no matter how many components there are, it will never be smaller
- provides methods like pack(), grid(), and place() to control the arrangement and positioning of widgets within a window

- **Add Custom Title:** `root.title("My TK Window")# Custom Title`
- **Window Size:**
