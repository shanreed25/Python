# Math Module
-  provides access to mathematical functions and constants
- commonly used for scientific computing, data analysis, and any application requiring mathematical operations beyond basic arithmetic
- primarily deals with floating-point numbers and does not support complex numbers
- for complex number operations, the cmath module is used
- must be imported first
    - `import math`
    - `from math import sqrt, pi`

# Key features of the math module
- **Mathematical Constants:** provides important mathematical constants such as math.pi (pi) and math.e (Euler's number).
- **Trigonometric Functions:** functions for sine (math.sin()), cosine (math.cos()), tangent (math.tan()), and their inverse and hyperbolic counterparts (e.g., math.asin(), math.cosh()).
- **Logarithmic and Power Functions:** functions for natural logarithm (math.log()), base-10 logarithm (math.log10()), exponentiation (math.exp()), and square root (math.sqrt()).
- **Rounding and Absolute Values:** functions like math.ceil() (rounds up), math.floor() (rounds down), math.trunc() (truncates to integer), and math.fabs() (absolute value for floats).
- **Other Mathematical Operations:** functions for factorials (math.factorial()), greatest common divisor (math.gcd()), error functions, and more.
