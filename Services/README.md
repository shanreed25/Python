# Service

# Python Anywhere
- an online integrated development environment (IDE) and web hosting service (Platform as a Service) based on the Python programming language
- aims to simplify the entire process of developing, running, and hosting Python applications, allowing users to concentrate on their code rather than infrastructure management

#### Online IDE
- allows you to write, run, and debug Python code directly within your web browser, eliminating the need to install and configure Python and development tools locally
#### Web Hosting (Platform as a Service)
- provides hosting for your Python-based web applications, like those built with frameworks such as Django and Flask. It manages the server infrastructure, letting you focus on your code.
#### Python-centric
- while it supports other command-line interfaces like Bash, its primary focus is on simplifying Python development and deployment
##### PythonAnywhere is a good option for
- Beginners learning Python due to its easy setup and readily available environment
- Web application developers looking for a simplified deployment process for their Python web apps
- Remote developers who need a cloud-based development environment accessible from anywhere
- Teachers and students to streamline the process of learning and teaching Python without installation headaches 

# How dashboard workd
#### Consoles
- are where you can type commands and see the result immediately
- Python consoles just run Python and Bash consoles (sometimes called the command line or terminals) are for system commands


#### Files
- If you want to write a program, you'll need to create a file to store it in
- the files panel shows files that you've edited recently, and you can click the 'Open another file' button to create a new file, or to edit an existing file

#### Web Apps
- You can create websites on PythonAnywhere; click 'Open Web tab' to set one up

#### Notebooks
- Paid PythonAnywhere accounts can create Jupyter Notebooks, a great way to do data analysis
