# Methods
- method is a function that belongs to a class and is defined within that class
- is called on an instance of that class (an object)
- are designed to operate on the data (attributes) of the object they are called upon and can modify the object's state
- the first parameter of a method is conventionally self, which refers to the instance of the class on which the method is called
**Methods are specialized procedures tied to specific objects. They are like actions an object can perform or properties it possesses.**
