# Basic Concepts of Python
**These basic concepts form the foundation of Python programming. As you continue learning, you will explore more advanced topics, but mastering these fundamentals is crucial for building a strong understanding of Python**


## [Variables](./)
-  containers for storing data

## Data Types
### Integers (int)
- Whole numbers (positive, negative, or zero), like 42 or -15.
### Floats
- Real numbers with decimal points, like 3.14 or 2.5.
### Strings (str)
- Sequences of characters, enclosed in single or double quotes, like "Hello, World!" or 'Python'.
### Booleans (bool)
- Representing True or False values, primarily used in decision-making.
### Lists
- Ordered and mutable collections of values, represented by square brackets [].
### Tuples
- Ordered and immutable collections of values, represented by parentheses ().
### Dictionaries
- Collections of key-value pairs, enclosed in curly braces {}.
### Sets
- Unordered collections of unique items, also using curly braces {}. 

## Operators
### Arithmetic Operators
-  Perform mathematical calculations like + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), % (modulus), ** (exponentiation), and // (floor division).
### Comparison Operators (Relational Operators)
- Compare values and return True or False. Examples include == (equal to), != (not equal to), > (greater than), < (less than), >= (greater than or equal to), and <= (less than or equal to).
### Assignment Operators
-  Assign values to variables. The most basic is =, but there are also shorthand operators like +=, -=, *= for common operations.
### Logical Operators
- Combine conditional statements (and, or, not)

## Control Flow
### [Conditional Statements](./ControlFlow/conditionalstatements.md)
- (if, elif, else): Allow different code blocks to run based on whether certain conditions are True or False
- if statement executes code if a condition is True.
- elif (else if) provides additional conditions to check if the preceding if or elif conditions were False.
- else statement executes code if all preceding conditions are False.
### [Loops](./ControlFlow/loops.md)
- Enable repetitive execution of code blocks
- for loops iterate over sequences like lists or tuples.
- while loops repeat a block of code as long as a condition remains True.
- break and continue statements can be used to control loop execution further. 

## Functions
- named blocks of reusable code that perform specific tasks
- You define functions using the def keyword, followed by the function name, parentheses containing optional parameters, and a colon.
- Functions can take input values (arguments) and optionally return output values using the return statement.
- Defining and using functions helps to organize your code, make it more modular, and promote reusability.
