# Functions
- a wrapper name for a block of code
- code designed to perform a specific task
- standalone block of code defined independently, not associated with any particular object or class
    - a [method](../Methods/methods.md) is a function that belongs to a class and is defined within that class
- can be called directly by its name from anywhere in the program where it is in scope
- typically operate on data passed to them as arguments and can return values
**Functions are general-purpose procedures. They are like tools you can use independently**
