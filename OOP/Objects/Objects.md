# Objects
- each object is a separate instance
- two objects made from the class could have different attributes and different methods 

# Object State
-  the "state" of an object refers to the values of its attributes/instance variables at any given point in time
- These attributes store the data that defines the unique characteristics and current condition of a specific instance of a class
- Instance Variables 
  - primarily hold object state
  - are unique to each object and store data specific to that object
- Class variables are shared by all instances of a class
