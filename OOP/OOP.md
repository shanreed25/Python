# Programming Paradigms
- fundamental styles or approaches to structuring and building computer programs
- represent different ways of thinking about and organizing code to solve problems
- each paradigm provides a set of concepts and principles that guide how programmers design, write, and execute their code

# Procedural Programming: Python 
- Procedural programming in Python involves structuring code into a series of procedures (or functions) that are executed in a sequential manner
- [More on Procedural Programming](procedduralprogramming.md)
- July2025 Projects are procedural programming

# Object-Oriented Programming(OOP)
- Organizes code around objects, which encapsulate data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data. 
- Key concepts include encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. 
- widely used in languages like Java, Python, and C++. 
- a programming paradigm that organizes code around objects rather than actions or logic
-  It's a way to structure programs by creating reusable 
  - "blueprints" (classes) that define objects with data (attributes) and functions (methods) that operate on that data. 
- OOP aims to model real-world entities and relationships, making code more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.

  Key Concepts of OOP:
  Objects: Instances of classes, representing real-world entities or concepts. 
  Classes: Blueprints for creating objects, defining their attributes and methods. 
  Encapsulation: Bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data within a class, hiding the internal details and exposing only a public interface. 
  Inheritance: Allowing a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (parent or superclass), promoting code reuse and hierarchical organization. 
  Polymorphism: The ability of objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in their own way, allowing for flexibility and dynamic behavior. 
  Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details and exposing only essential information to the user, simplifying interaction with objects. 
  Benefits of OOP:
  Modularity: Breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable objects. 
  Code Reusability: Inheritance and other OOP features allow for reusing code, reducing redundancy and development time. 
  Maintainability: Well-structured OOP code is easier to understand, modify, and debug. 
  Scalability: OOP principles make it easier to build large and complex systems. 
  Real-world Modeling: OOP allows developers to model real-world entities and their relationships in a more intuitive way. 
  OOP Languages:
  Many popular programming languages support OOP, including: Java, C++, Python, C#, Ruby, and JavaScript.
