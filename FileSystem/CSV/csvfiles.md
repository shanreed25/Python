# How CSV files work
- **Rows and Columns:** Each line in the CSV file represents a row in the table. 
- **Fields/Values:** Within each row, commas separate the individual data values (fields). 
- A CSV file might look like this: 
    ```
    Name,Age,City
    John,30,New York
    Alice,25,London
    Bob,35,Paris
    ```
