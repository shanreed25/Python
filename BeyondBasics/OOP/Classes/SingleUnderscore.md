# self._ 
- refers to an instance attribute of a class that, by convention, is intended for internal or "private" use within the class
- **_ (single underscore)**: when used as a prefix to an attribute or method name (` self._attribute_name`), it serves as a naming convention to signal that the element is primarily for internal use within the class or module
- Python does not enforce true privacy, this convention indicates to other developers that they should generally avoid directly accessing or modifying such attributes from outside the class, as their internal implementation might change in future versions
