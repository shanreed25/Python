# Loops
**Enable repetitive execution of code blocks**


## for loops
**Iterate over sequences like lists or tuples**

## while loops
**Repeat a block of code as long as a condition remains True**


## break and continue
**Can be used to control loop execution further**
# `break` statement
- used to immediately terminate the execution of the innermost for or while loop in which it is located
- used for early termination of a loop based on a condition, rather than letting the loop complete all its iterations
- the loop is exited, and program control proceeds to the statement immediately following the loop
- typically placed within an if condition inside the loop
    - means the loop will only terminate when a specific condition is met
- only exits the innermost loop it's contained within, not any outer or encapsulating loops
- can be used in both for and while loops
