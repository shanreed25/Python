## Control Flow
### [Conditional Statements](./ControlFlow/conditionalstatements.md)
- (if, elif, else): Allow different code blocks to run based on whether certain conditions are True or False
- if statement executes code if a condition is True.
- elif (else if) provides additional conditions to check if the preceding if or elif conditions were False.
- else statement executes code if all preceding conditions are False.
### [Loops](./ControlFlow/loops.md)
- Enable repetitive execution of code blocks
- for loops iterate over sequences like lists or tuples.
- while loops repeat a block of code as long as a condition remains True.
- break and continue statements can be used to control loop execution further.
