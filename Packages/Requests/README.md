# [Python's Requests library](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)
- https://realpython.com/python-requests/
- external library designed to simplify the process of making HTTP requests in Python
- offers a user-friendly and intuitive API that abstracts away the complexities of working with network protocols, making it easier for developers to interact with web services and APIs
- a fundamental tool for any Python developer working with web-based data, APIs, or web scraping, due to its "HTTP for Humans" design philosophy


### Simplified HTTP Requests
- provides straightforward functions for common HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc., making it easy to send data to or retrieve data from web servers.
### Handling Responses
- simplifies the processing of server responses, allowing easy access to status codes, headers, and body content (including automatic handling of JSON and text responses)
### Authentication and Sessions
- requests supports various authentication methods and allows for the creation of Session objects to persist parameters and cookies across multiple requests, mimicking browser-like behavior
### SSL Verification
- handles SSL certificate verification for secure HTTPS connections, ensuring data integrity and security by default
### Proxies
- supports routing requests through proxy servers, useful for tasks like bypassing geo-restrictions or managing IP addresses
### File Uploads
- provides an easy way to upload files as part of a POST request


# Types of Requests
