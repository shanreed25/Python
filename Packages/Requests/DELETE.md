# `requests.delete()`
- used to send an HTTP DELETE request to a specified URL
- primarily used to remove or delete a resource on a server


#### Parameters:
- **url**: The URL of the resource to be deleted. This is a required parameter.
- **`: kwargs`**: Optional keyword arguments that allow customization of the request, such as:
- **headers**: A dictionary of HTTP headers to send with the request (e.g., for authentication like Authorization or specifying Content-Type).
- **auth**: Authentication credentials (e.g., HTTPBasicAuth).
- **params**: A dictionary of URL query parameters.
- **data**: A dictionary, bytes, or file-like object to send as the request body (though less common for DELETE requests, as the URL typically identifies the resource to be deleted).
- **json**: A JSON serializable object to send as the request body with Content-Type: application/json.
- **cookies**: A dictionary of cookies to send.
- **timeout**: A float or tuple specifying a timeout for the request.
- **proxies**: A dictionary mapping protocol to proxy URL.

#### Return Value
- the requests.delete() method returns a requests.Response object, which contains information about the server's response, including:
    - response.status_code: The HTTP status code (e.g., 200 for OK, 204 for No Content, 404 for Not Found).
    - response.reason: The reason phrase for the status code.
    - response.text: The response content as a string.
    - response.json(): If the response content is JSON, this method returns it as a Python dictionary or list.
