# Python Packages
- a directory that contains multiple Python modules and potentially other sub-packages
    - essentially a collection of modules
    - enable hierarchical organization of multiple related modules
- to be recognized as a package, this directory must contain a special file named `__init__.py` 
- `__init__.py` can be empty, or it can contain initialization code for the package
- packages provide a way to organize related modules into a hierarchical structure, improving code organization and preventing naming conflicts
- imported using their directory name, often with dot notation to access specific modules within them (e.g., import my_package.module_a)
