# API ENDPOINT
**When an application wants to access a specific piece of data or perform a certain action through an API, it directs its request to the corresponding API endpoint**
- a specific, addressable location within an Application Programming Interface (API) where an application can send requests and receive responses
-  the precise locations that enable communication and data exchange between different software applications through an API
- serves as the point of interaction for accessing a particular resource or executing a specific function offered by the API
- **URL** endpoints are typically represented by a Uniform Resource Locator (URL), which acts as their unique address on the internet.
- **Resource or Function:** each endpoint is designed to expose a specific resource (a list of users, a single product etc...) or a particular function (creating a new user, updating an order etc...).
- **HTTP Methods:** endpoints often support various HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to define the type of operation to be performed on the resource.
- **Request/Response:** an application sends a request to an endpoint, and the API server processes it and sends back a response, which can include data, a status code, or error messages.
